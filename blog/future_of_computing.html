Future of computer history museum

55 years of engelbardt HCI. Is mouse + keyboard + gui HCI endgame?

Possible futures. How they interact etc...
Cloud, mobile, XR, AI, decentralized networks, internetworks, natural computation (bio, neuro etc...) etc...

Future of software engineering / computer programming. Tool assisted. AI assisted. Programming lanugages. Software 2.0. Software efficiency / craft (jblow, industry incentives).

My values I'll be operating on / properties I think computing should have to be most beneficial.

Ubiquitous
Software 2.0
Spatial
Intelligent
Personal / Sovereign
Secure
Open, composable
Social
Ambient
Full spectrum
Intuitive. Natural extension of yourself
Humanity centric

Bycicles for the mind. Tools for thought. Do what I mean. What you think is what you get.
Why else are we building and deploying these things?

55 years since mother of all demos (1968)
First touchscreen was 1965

2023 marks 55 years since The Mother of All Demos, in which the dominant HCI paradigms of mouse, keyboard and GUI were introduced to the world. 

Mainframe
PC
Mobile + cloud
Distributed?

Mouse
Pen
Touchscreen
Spatially Tracked controller
Spatially Tracked hands
AI interface
Brain computer interface

CRT
Flat displays
HMD
Direct sensorium control

XR, AI, Blockchain, E-ink, Pen input, IoT, Internet / Web / Metaverse

Software engineering.
    The more proficient I have become, the more I am noticing the cracks in this young art (that AI wont neccessarily fix (may actually exasserbate it))
Visual programming.
English language programming with LLMs
Copilotting. AI model assisted software development
Solving the multiple sources of truth problem.
Better programming languages
Kaparthy software 2.0 (Coding using data and generic inference engine)

Open source, foss

We've known since the beginning where this whole computing thing is going. Bicycles for the mind. Enhancing the capabilitie of individuals and the species.

What do I mean when I say I'm building the future of computing?

AI as the everything app. The final interface.

All IO mechanisms have been exercizes in reducing bandwith between human and computer. Intuition dimension / bandwidth floor / bandwidth cieling. Its all execortex.

What is / should the future of computing?
What are computers?
Where are we going / what does the future look like / what values should it have?
    values, HCI, distribution, open source, how we make software / program it 
What am I doing / where do I fit in?

Side topics?
