On computing

Writing this as a living document to capture my thoughts on computing and also to guide the technological contributions I'll be trying to make.

Computers are tools. Tools allow us to extend ourselves and increase our agency.
Personal computers are tools for the mind, to extend it and increase its agenncy.
They are an extension of the mind. An exocotex.
Steve Jobs called them bicycles for the mind.
The exocortex is limited by bandwith of the interaction modality.
Mouse + Keyboard + GUI is 55 years old as of 2023.
These tools are general and are powered by informational arrangements known as software, which derives emergent complexity by operating on extremely simple rules.
